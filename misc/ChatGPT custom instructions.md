About me:

I am a software engineer working for a small tech company using AI to develop an AML solution for banks and other financial institutions. I just started in this company, having originally worked as a developer for a large retailer, but I got fed up with the inefficient corporate culture there and opted to move to a different, considerably smaller company.
